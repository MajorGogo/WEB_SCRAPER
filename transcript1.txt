in this video i'm going to show you an
entire computer science degree in 12
minutes we're going to learn everything
from the basics to how to hack twitter
let's go code is just instructions that
execute line by line functions are just
self-contained reusable chunks of code a
function is recursive if it calls itself
trees are data structures for storing
numbers if we had five at the top
everything to the left would have to be
smaller than it so this could be zero
everything to the right would have to be
bigger than it this is true for every
single node variables can store some
data in them and that data can change as
you can see here aka their variable
conditionals will check variables and
run different code depending on what the
value of those variables is loops check
some condition and they keep repeating
until that condition is met structures
logically store some information
together to make it easier to access for
example person has a name and has an age
arrays are essentially just lists of
variables we can overwrite any one of
these values and they sit next to each
other in storage when you're programming
every time a function is called it
creates what's called a stack frame with
this function if we called it with i
equals 10 this is what our stack frame
would look like we start off with a
stack with i equals 10 but then we were
cursed on ourselves as you can see here
with i equals nine and then we know from
this stack frame we're gonna have to
return to the one before it this will go
all the way down until i equals one and
then these stack frames will start
popping off as the code is returning to
the previous stack frame all of this is
stuff that you don't have to manage
yourself this is just done for you
automatically this is just how it's
stored in memory now this is interesting
if you forgot your base case and you
continued to recurse on yourself
infinitely you would run out of stack
memory so you only have so much memory
allocated to stack and if you created so
many stack frames that you accidentally
ran out of stock memory this is called
stack overflow it's all making sense now
doesn't it sometimes when the stack pops
we want the memory to stay around so
there's this thing
called keep memory in c the way you're
going to allocate on the heap is using
the malik keyword but if you've ever
used c plus plus or java the way you do
it is with the new keyword if something
is allocated on the heap you are
returned a pointer to that value which
just looks like an address what's really
cool is that pointers are actually the
exact same thing as arrays because a
pointer points to an address and an
array points to the first element of a
list as an address this is how we will
create an array of size four on the heap
however what malek is actually going to
return to us is actually just this
address so if we wanted to access the
second element of the array we could
literally just take the array and plus
one that would give us this address if
statements in some pretty cool ways if
you had a and b which are both boolean
so they either are true or they're false
and you had an if statement that was if
not
a
or
not b
this is actually the exact same thing as
if
not
a
and b programmers do everything from the
terminal it's the scary looking black
box you see whenever somebody's hacking
in one of the movies this is actually
your best friend and you're gonna run
most of your code from this it's not
scary please get comfortable with it all
of the commands that you use to run in
this terminal are called bash commands
so ls for example will list all of the
folders and files in this current
directory as you can see i clearly made
a mistake naming this file
commands can have additional arguments
to them that are defined so for example
ls has a dash a option which is going to
show me all the files and folders
including the hidden ones as you can see
we've got a bunch of random folders here
c plus is just c but with classes and
objects as you can see in front of me
now something really cool about the name
c plus plus actually means c equals c
plus one
in the c programming language so c plus
plus is just a way of them saying it's c
but it's one better than c now something
even more interesting is that c sharp is
just c
plus plus plus plus so it's c plus two i
don't know i thought it was cool it's
impossible to measure algorithms with
time because every computer has a
different chip it has a different
setting that has a different speed so
the way we measure algorithm speed is
with number of steps in fact we don't
even care about the number of actual
steps we just care about how many steps
in relation to the input size this is
called big o of n notation there are a
few really interesting data structures
the first would be a queue a queue adds
things to the back and it takes them
from the front much like a queue at a
grocery store or a coffee shop a stack
adds to the top and takes from the top a
good example of a stack would be a stack
of books put one on top and then you
take off the top also trees we already
went over linked lists basically store
some data and then a pointer to the next
data some data pointer to the next data
and then know if it's the end of the
list now all computers run on
transistors transistors run off of a
sequence of ones and zeros which make up
instructions machine code are
instructions that run on the transistors
it's built from assembly assembly are
basically these instructions but in
english and the assembly is created from
our friend
c
we come full circle on a computer all
numbers are represented as binary ones
and zeros now if we need to represent a
negative number you might be saying well
couldn't we just add a one or zero to
right here one would represent negative
and zero would represent positive the
problem with that that would give us two
representations of the number zero so
they've invented this thing called two's
complement which essentially is a way of
storing numbers that are positive and
negative in binary that doesn't have
this property i'll let you google that
on your own let's say you're on a
mountain range right here and you want
to get to the tallest mountain in that
mountain range now you really can't see
too far because it's very foggy a greedy
algorithm tells you to take the local
optimal it just says don't go down only
go up because you'll be higher than you
were before so with a greedy algorithm
you would make it here and that's pretty
tall but that's not actually the tallest
point divide and conquer algorithms take
a complex problem and break it into an
easier problem operating systems have
these things called kernels kernel
basically manages the system every time
you said new or every time you opened a
file you were actually just asking the
kernel to do it for you remember back
when we told you code runs line by line
well that's still true this sequential
running is called a thread of execution
now what we didn't tell you is that you
can have multiple threads of execution
running at the same time
now in the last month this channel has
gone from 3 000 subscribers to 40 000
subscribers if we can get to a hundred
thousand in the next 30 days i will
shave my head as a reward now let's talk
about my favorite thing
hacking generally comes when you let the
user input something in this case
twitter might have a text box for
tweeting most people would say hello
world if i knew that they were storing
my tweet in an array that was allocated
on the stack i could actually take
advantage of that this is the stack
frame for the function that's writing my
tweet now let's say that they said this
tweet was allocated on the stack and it
can be of length one two three four if i
make a tweet that has more than four
characters in it which i'm obviously
going to do i could keep going and
eventually
overrun the return address now what's
really interesting is if i put malicious
code right up here then all i have to do
is write the rest of the array with the
return address being where that
malicious code is so when this stack
frame is ready to pop off it will return
to my code this is called a buffer
overflow machine learning relies heavily
on neural networks neural networks are
set up to act kind of like the human
brain each individual node is called a
neuron it takes some input and it either
produces a one or it produces a zero we
have multiple layers of neurons and then
we have this thing called an output
layer as you can see the output is
either a circle triangle or a square now
the output is going to look something
like 0.5 maybe 0.2 0.3
what this is saying is it's a 50
probability that it's a circle now these
are called the hidden layers these are
the layers that do most of the
computation and then this is called the
input layer and what this does is it
cuts this image up into pixels and then
each of these input nodes basically just
represents the pixel data at each of
those pixels now what's cool about these
is that every single node is connected
to every other node in the layer above
it each of these connections has what's
called
a
weight now what is the weight it's
actually just completely random at the
beginning now let's zoom in for a second
each node is connected to the nodes in
front of it the input for any given node
is the weight multiplied by the output
so if this outputs a one and this
outputs a zero the input for this node
is going to be
one
times w1
plus
0
times w2 each of these nodes
takes whatever their input is let's say
the input is 0.3 and it decides if it
wants to output a one or a zero so
basically every single node only outputs
a one or a zero it's very simple the
real magic are these weights now
remember i told you there's an output
probability about which shape is right
so let's say we passed in an image of a
circle and it ended up telling us that
it's a 90 probability it's a square well
because this is training data we know
that that's wrong so what we do is we go
back through all the layers of nodes we
adjust all of their weights to represent
something that will actually give us the
right answer and then we keep doing that
on repeat until we get all of the
weights just right and that's what a
neural network is one of the lesser
known but very cool things in
programming is called a co-routine now
what co-routines allow you to do is this
thing called a yield return which will
let you return but more just pause the
function where it is for example in a
regular function if we did a return this
code would be completely inaccessible
because every single time we called this
function it would set x to zero and then
it would return x but with a co routine
we pause execution when we yield return
and then when we call it again it just
continues on now that might sound kind
of useless but it actually has a really
good use case imagine we wanted to write
a function that returned every single
node in a binary tree what we could do
is write a function that would return
the first node and then when we called
it again it would have to remember that
it's already returned the first node and
then it would return the second node and
then the next time we call it it would
have to remember it returned the first
node and returned the second node and it
would have to return the third node but
with co routines you can have a function
that returns the first node and then
yield returns and then when you call it
again it just calls the next node and
when you call it again it calls the next
node it's really really useful for
enumerators obviously that process is
called enumerating now if you didn't
understand most of that don't worry
please you're not supposed to do not
feel bad this is meant to give you the
first one
of these topics when you go to learn a
new topic if you already have any basic
familiarity with it it makes it much
easier to learn this is just giving you
that little bit that might help you when
you're finally learning it watch this
video again and write down all the
topics you don't know and then go
through them one by one and research
them alright go break some eggs
