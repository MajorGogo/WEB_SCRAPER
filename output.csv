Icy_Bad2427,"The stats speak for themselves - Ruturaj
  
    But the insane amount of hate Gill has gotten in this series in every match was so unwarranted. Just let it go now and wait for the next series where a senior will be back to captain bruh.",
Even_Salamander6315,"It was not unwarranted, he demoted Abhishek to cement his own position. He knows batting in powerplay will make his stats look better.",
AdAware7385,He ain't Rohit sharma or kohli. He doesn't hold that power,
Random_Simp1234,"do you really think gill has a say in the XI? if you watched the toss today he didnâ€™t even remember who was dropped because its hugely a coachâ€™s decision (+mgmt). Sad to say but indian captains have very less say, especially when its a junior experimental captain in a useless bilateral series against zim.",
Even_Salamander6315,Disagree. He may not have say in squad selection but he has say in Team selection both are different. Even on Rohits call both Axar and Jadeja were selected in the WC.  Saying he did not have say is an excuse.,
Random_Simp1234,"comparing rohitâ€™s decision making is absurd here. One, its Rohit, heâ€™s experienced and a senior who works WITH his coach, unlike shubman who is a debut captain with little experience who works UNDER his coach. Two, that was a world cup, things were much high stake there, unlike this series where experimenting the young lads was the priority.",
Even_Salamander6315,So you mean he can't even decide batting order?,
Random_Simp1234,"he can, but he doesnâ€™t. its as simple. the seniors are rested, shubman is being experimented as captain on field but is not yet experienced to the extent that he gets to make the big decisions.",
KeyFit8457,Rohit is the permanent captain of India and most senior player. How can you compare him to a newbie like gill lol.,
Random_Simp1234,exactly my point.,
ChaiPioBiscuitKhao,Both. Long time for a WC. We'll play more than 35 t20is .,
Aryan_Radha_ka_pati,Gill*,
ChaiPioBiscuitKhao,"No.
  
    If you say there's a WC a week from now and I had to pick only one right now, I'd pick Rutu. he looks in good touch, he is playing with confidence.
  
    Bilaterals are there for experiment and team building and to prep for ICC events.",
PowerfulChocolate106,"Bas karo b.k.l bas karo, Zimbabve se match tha, world cup ka final nahi tha jo apni ego hurt karke bethe ho. Dimag nahi hain to mat lagao",
nmzsm5678hx,"I would have pin this.
  
    Players like KL won against SA in SA are out of pictures now a days. And here OP wants to compare against ZIM!!",
aryan889889,Bisleri yellow dogs for a reason,
wisely25,7 downvotes....yk the reason,
ak_6942,"Now you have 7 upvotes, we all know the reason",
Ok_Trouble_6739,"""-7 votes"" or ""7 downvotes""",
wisely25,Dayum my bad...fixed it,
Alternative-Search-4,7 upvotes,
Any-Experience-1808,"Both of them are going to play more matches in T20i. Gill gets a higher ceiling because he's already fixed in 2 formats. But if Rutu continues to outperform him, he'll get the spot. Too soon to say rn.",
Agitated-Concept2949,Bhai abhi judge nhi kr skte I wish sena countries mai Odis and t20s ho .Strong opposition bhi hoga and difficult conditions bhi hogi .Tab pta chlega king title haqdaar kon hai,
Aryan_Radha_ka_pati,Ruturaj 10 t20is vs sena*Gill:-8,
Ragnarok_619,Shouldn't we have 2 stars on the jersey now?,
crzylprv56,I had the same question but I think the jersey was made before we won,
Gliding_Petal,"Both. I'd give Gill probably 15 more matches until ruling him out from the T20 setup. Gaikwad is the preference, without a doubt. Knowing GG, I think he would give Gill some rope too in T20s.",
Historical-Prompt-10,Give him at least 100 matches bro!,
ARITHENERD1945,"I have been telling this again and again , jaiswal and gill should open and rutu should be at 1st down. Peak!!",
MonkeyDMeatt,Do no khelenge Gill opening along with Jaiswal and Ruturaj at 3,
MrHolmes6969696,Abhishek?,
MonkeyDMeatt,He has to prove himself with current game style he is way too unpredictable. Jaiswal and Gill are more likely stable pair with Ruturaj coming at 3,
MrHolmes6969696,Fair enough,
LessYard2322,"I would choose Gaikwad, but unfortunately Brand Value is a thing that Exists in Indian cricket.",
LessYard2322,Gill lol. They sell the series in the name of GillðŸ˜‚,
BiswarupNandi0875,Ruturaj Gaikawad,
josephpvmathew,"Rutraj-t20, GillÃ—odi=jaiswal",
FewAdhesiveness8702,"Is it even a legal question ? Idk why shubman  is so hyped , for his ipl ??? Or for his u19 world cup ?",
LessYard2322,"Combination of his flair in U19 and a narrative being built around him as Kohli's successor (Add to that one great IPL season where he ousted RCB). I remember when Tendulkar was close to retirement no one was given the baton, Rohit, Kohli and a few other youngsters were fighting for that spot.",
vishwa02,"Stats don't matter, names do.
  
    It's BCCI ffs.",
C4ptainPR1CE,First pay me my salary then i will tell you,
Mammothorian,Gaikwad,
Kind_Outcome5466,"Both will be in team .
  
    Opener and a one down",
adivenk93,Ruturaj Gaikwad,
Old-Examination-9573,Openers in T20iâ€™s should be Yashasvi Abhishek/Pant (Pant should be played as opener or otherwise pant does not deserve to be in 11) Ruturaj at 3 should be made permanent,
dr_alchemist,"To be very honest Gill has a higher ceiling than Gaikwad but also a lower floor than Gaikwad. But Gaikwad is much more consistent. Maybe because we have Abhishek, Jaiswal and sky we need a bit more consistent performer than another hitter. So maybe Gaikwad but I'm not sure.",
Suyash4126,Gill because he is PRince gwag gwag,
Fun-Elk6622,People in the coments saying ceiling is just their last hope to defend gill lol. From when are we seeing it over performance. If he has the ceiling let him break into the scene when he is at his peak. You can't keep deserved players like Ruturaj on bench for a guy who might peak some day in coming years.,
forelsketparadise1,Ruturaj always. Gill doesn't belong to T20 set up. Ruturaj kept up with Virat in Orange cap fight while being a captain that needed to adapt,

GiraffeWaste,none,
Expensive-Musician70,"If you are a selector and you have a job for creating a 15 member for future big tournaments and 5-6 reserves , what will you do? Will you play only one team because some 10th failed kid want his favourite ipl team player in team ? Get a life rat",
Shattered-Dreams19,"ruturaj is probably in his peak 3-4 years as he is 28
  
    Gill is 24 still young. Hasn't touched his peak years. Gill doesn't take 20 balls at a SR of less than 100 to get set. If they really wanted an anchor, kohli is their best bet at no. 3.
  
    Gill has shown his Mattel in ODIs... he can do the same in t20is.
  
    Gill has way better domestic stats.
  
    Gill has a waaay higher ceiling",
Fun-Elk6622,Bro is trying to find random ass points to defend gills spot over rutu lol.,
Aryan_Radha_ka_pati,Domestics includes List A with FC too Not only FC,
Normal-Brush-4596,"Since Zimbabwe series has begun, most of the posts in the sub have been CSK fans trying to sell Ruturaj over Gill",
BeingComfortablyDumb,I swear. CSK fans selling Ruturaj and SRH fans selling Abhishek Sharma. They don't care about anything else other than to see their franchise star shine.,
Alternative-Search-4,Stats don't lie m8 ðŸ¤—,
th3_Real_Deal,Captain Ruturaj,
Crazydeed,"As GG is the Coach, he will choose Prithvi Shaw !!",
Alternative-Search-4,Does prithvi also have some insane feats in domestic cricket (cause gg said T20 will be based on ipl and test will be based on 1st class),
Alternative_Risk3793,Shubhman Gill is more social media famous and I think that is why he is more endorsed but considering the stats Ruturaj any day,
Not_A-Pedophile_,"The problem is we are thinking of replacing koach
  
    And i dont think gill has proven it in international
  
    Gaikward proved it
  
    Thats why i think they are thinking him for no 3 and gill for opening because right lefty combination which is brain ded",
ManSlutAlternative,Ruturaj. Gill always loses his cool and looks uncomfortable under pressure. He has given his wicket away uselessly many times. Bashing weak teams will not  cement your legacy.,
Snoo-92685,"Let's be honest, if the stats were reversed, no one would be even giving Gaikwad a chance. I've seen more comments doing damage control for Gill this series than praising Gaikwad.",
fellow_manusan,"Idk about gill, but rutu would make a fantastic ODI player.",
MrHolmes6969696,"Dude is way too obsessed with Ruturaj, his every other post has Ruturaj, not that itâ€™s bad",
Expensive-Musician70,I definitely won't listen to you for sure,
Horror_Feedback8505,PRince is damad of GOD of cricket,
aamere-nunupe-bethja,"Gill.
  
    Because his ceiling is insane.",
BeingComfortablyDumb,"Man these CSK fans just downvote an opposing opinion. ""Agree with us or fuck off"" mentality.  I love Dhoni but these CSK fans are just intolerable",
Himanshu-O_O,Ruturaj is overrated af,
Fun-Elk6622,Shows ur ball knowledge,
Himanshu-O_O,,
zippyzebu9,None. I donâ€™t select mediocre players.,
